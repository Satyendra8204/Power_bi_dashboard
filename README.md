Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of the end-to-end data pipeline, from gathering data across disparate sources to performing data modeling and executing the ETL processes. Each team's unique requirements were met through customized dashboards, using diverse charts and visualizations to highlight specific patterns and insights. For instance, I utilized line charts for trend analysis in sales, bar charts for financial comparisons, and heat maps for supply chain efficiency. Managing the project plan and stakeholder expectations was crucial, ensuring timely delivery and alignment with business objectives. This experience significantly enhanced my skills in data visualization, cross-functional communication, and agile project management, proving the versatility and power of Power BI as a business intelligence tool.
